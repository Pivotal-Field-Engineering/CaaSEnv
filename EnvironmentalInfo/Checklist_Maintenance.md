#  Checklist for Maintenance

This document will outlines manual steps for regular maintenance of the CaaS environment.  It is hoped that we will eventually replace all these steps with automation scripts, but for now here are the main items.

- [ ] clean up old NSX-T backups so OpsMan VM does not use all disk
- [ ] check for latest stem cell updates and apply
- [ ] validation of matrix support
